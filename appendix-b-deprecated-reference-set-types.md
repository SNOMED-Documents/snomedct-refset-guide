# Appendix B:  Deprecated Reference Set Types

This section contains information about reference set types that are now deprecated and replaced by enhanced reference set. The fact that a referenced set type is deprecated does **not** imply that reference sets of that type cannot be used. However, it does indicate that there is another reference set type that more effectively meets the use case(s) for which these reference sets were originally designed.
