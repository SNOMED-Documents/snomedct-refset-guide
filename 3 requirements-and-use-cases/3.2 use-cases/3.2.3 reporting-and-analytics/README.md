# 3.2.3. Reporting and Analytics

The main benefits of using an EHR accrue with the implementation of effective retrieval, analysis and reuse of clinical information. Analysis of health record data may cover:

* Individual patient records to search for significant patterns that may prompt interventions
* Patient groups or cohorts, based on demographics, diagnoses, treatments or interventions
* Enterprise groups, based on teams, wards, clinics, institutions or providers
* Geographical groups, based on a local area, town, region or country

SNOMED CT has a number of unique features, which makes it capable of supporting a range of retrieval and analytics functions, which use reference sets. Examples include, but are not limited to:

* [Simple reference sets](../../../3%20requirements-and-use-cases/3.2%20use-cases/3.2.3%20reporting-and-analytics/5.1-Simple-Reference-Set_35985677.html) can be used to represent subsets of SNOMED CT concepts which can be used in queries to identify clinical records
* [Simple reference sets](../../../3%20requirements-and-use-cases/3.2%20use-cases/3.2.3%20reporting-and-analytics/5.1-Simple-Reference-Set_35985677.html) can be used to represent non-standard aggregations of concepts for specific use cases
* [Simple map reference sets](../../../pages/createpage.action), [complex and extended map reference sets](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/5.2.3.3+Complex+and+Extended+Map+from+SNOMED+CT+Reference+Sets) can be used to define maps from other code systems to SNOMED CT so that clinical data can be prepared for analytics, and then performed using SNOMED CT
* [Simple reference sets](../../../3%20requirements-and-use-cases/3.2%20use-cases/3.2.3%20reporting-and-analytics/5.1-Simple-Reference-Set_35985677.html) and [ordered reference sets](../../../3%20requirements-and-use-cases/3.2%20use-cases/3.2.3%20reporting-and-analytics/Ordered-Reference-Set_35985666.html) can be used to define language or dialect specific sets of descriptions over which lexical searches can be performed

The document [Data Analytics with SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCANLYT) provides detailed information about how SNOMED CT can be used for analytics.
