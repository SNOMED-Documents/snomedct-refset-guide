# 3.2.6.3.2. Representing Historical Associations

When a new version of SNOMED CT is released this may include changes to the content of the terminology. Components may have been added, inactivated or changed as described in [11.4 Versioning](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCANLYT/11.4+Versioning). As part of the terminology maintenance process, it may be appropriate to evaluate both the [Representing Reasons for Component Inactivation](3.2.6.3.1.-Representing-Reasons-for-Component-Inactivation_35985652.html) and to determine appropriate alternatives.

The International Edition of SNOMED CT distributes a set of reference sets that record the reason that each inactive component was inactivated. These are referred to as "historical association" reference sets (see [4.2.3 Historical Association Reference Sets](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=DOCTSG&title=4.2.3+Historical+Association+Reference+Sets) for more details). There is one historical association reference set for each type of historical association as shown in the table below. 

Table 3.2.6.3.2-1: Association reference set types in the International Release of SNOMED CT

Association reference set| Descriptions  
---|---  
[ 900000000000523009 | POSSIBLY EQUIVALENT TO association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000523009 "900000000000523009 | POSSIBLY EQUIVALENT TO association reference set |") | Applies to a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") that is ambiguous. The targetComponent is an active [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") that represents one of the possible meanings of the inactive [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") . Multiple rows are used to refer to each of the possible meanings of the ambiguous [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept").  
[ 900000000000524003 | MOVED TO association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000524003 "900000000000524003 | MOVED TO association reference set |") | Applies to a [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") that has been moved to (or are pending a move to) another namespace. The targetComponent identifies the target namespace (not the new [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") ).   
[ 900000000000525002 | MOVED FROM association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000525002 "900000000000525002 | MOVED FROM association reference set |") | Applies to a [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") that has been moved to this namespace from another namespace. The targetComponent identifies the original [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component")[Identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Identifier "Glossary link: Identifier") in its previous namespace.   
[ 900000000000526001 | REPLACED BY association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000526001 "900000000000526001 | REPLACED BY association reference set |") | Applies to an erroneous, obsolete and other [inactive component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive+component "Glossary link: inactive component") for which there is a single active replacement. The targetComponent identifies the active [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") that replaces this [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component").  
[ 900000000000527005 | SAME AS association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000527005 "900000000000527005 | SAME AS association reference set |") | Applies to a [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") that is a duplicate. The targetComponent identifies the active [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") that this [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") duplicates.   
[ 900000000000528000 | WAS A association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000528000 "900000000000528000 | WAS A association reference set |") | Links an inactive classification [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") such as "not otherwise specified" or "otherwise specified" with the active [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") that was formerly its most proximal supertype.   
[ 900000000000529008 | SIMILAR TO association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000529008 "900000000000529008 | SIMILAR TO association reference set |") | (not used currently)  
[ 900000000000530003 | ALTERNATIVE association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000530003 "900000000000530003 | ALTERNATIVE association reference set |") | Links an inactive classification [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") derived from ICD-9 Chapter XVI "Symptoms signs and ill-defined conditions" with the most similar active [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept").  
[ 900000000000531004 | REFERS TO concept association reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000531004 "900000000000531004 | REFERS TO concept association reference set |") | Applies to an inactive [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") which is inappropriate to the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") it is directly linked to but instead should refer to the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") referenced by the targetComponent.   
  
  

The following table holds example entries for the [ 900000000000526001 | Replaced by|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000526001 "900000000000526001 | Replaced by |") reference set. With this reference set is possible to automatically identify that the inactive concept [ 696005 | Chronobiologic disorder|](http://snomed.info/id/696005 "696005 | Chronobiologic disorder |") should be replaced with the concept [ 387605007 | Abnormal chronobiologic state|](http://snomed.info/id/387605007 "387605007 | Abnormal chronobiologic state |") . This type of reference set is particularly useful for ensuring consistent use of SNOMED CT over time. The reference set mechanism here provides an easy and standardized way of managing changes to coding or documentation practice over time.
