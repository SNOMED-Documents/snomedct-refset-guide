# 3.2.6.3.2. Representing Historical Associations

When a new version of SNOMED CT is released this may include changes to the content of the terminology. Components may have been added, inactivated or changed as described in [11.4 Versioning](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCANLYT/11.4+Versioning). As part of the terminology maintenance process, it may be appropriate to evaluate both the [Representing Reasons for Component Inactivation](../../../../3%20requirements-and-use-cases/3.2%20use-cases/3.2.6%20maintenance-and-management/3.2.6.3%20managing-component-inactivation/3.2.6.3.1.-Representing-Reasons-for-Component-Inactivation_35985652.html) and to determine appropriate alternatives.

The International Edition of SNOMED CT distributes a set of reference sets that record the reason that each inactive component was inactivated. These are referred to as "historical association" reference sets (see [4.2.3 Historical Association Reference Sets](../../../../pages/createpage.action) for more details). There is one historical association reference set for each type of historical association as shown in the table below.

Table 3.2.6.3.2-1: Association reference set types in the International Release of SNOMED CT

| Association reference set | Descriptions                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \[ 900000000000523009     | POSSIBLY EQUIVALENT TO association reference set |
| \[ 900000000000524003     | MOVED TO association reference set               |
| \[ 900000000000525002     | MOVED FROM association reference set             |
| \[ 900000000000526001     | REPLACED BY association reference set            |
| \[ 900000000000527005     | SAME AS association reference set                |
| \[ 900000000000528000     | WAS A association reference set                  |
| \[ 900000000000529008     | SIMILAR TO association reference set             |
| \[ 900000000000530003     | ALTERNATIVE association reference set            |
| \[ 900000000000531004     | REFERS TO concept association reference set      |

The following table holds example entries for the [900000000000526001 | Replaced by|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000526001) reference set. With this reference set is possible to automatically identify that the inactive concept [696005 | Chronobiologic disorder|](http://snomed.info/id/696005) should be replaced with the concept [387605007 | Abnormal chronobiologic state|](http://snomed.info/id/387605007) . This type of reference set is particularly useful for ensuring consistent use of SNOMED CT over time. The reference set mechanism here provides an easy and standardized way of managing changes to coding or documentation practice over time.
