# 3.2.6.3.1. Representing Reasons for Component Inactivation

In the International Edition of SNOMED CT three reference sets of the type  [ 900000000000480006 | Attribute value type reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000480006 "900000000000480006 | Attribute value type reference set |") are used to indicate the reason why components have been inactivated. These are: 

  * [ 900000000000489007 | Concept inactivation indicator attribute value reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000489007 "900000000000489007 | Concept inactivation indicator attribute value reference set \(foundation metadata concept\) |")
  * [ 900000000000490003 | Description inactivation indicator attribute value reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000490003 "900000000000490003 | Description inactivation indicator attribute value reference set \(foundation metadata concept\) |")

  * [ 900000000000547002 | Relationship inactivation indicator attribute value reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000547002 "900000000000547002 | Relationship inactivation indicator attribute value reference set \(foundation metadata concept\) |")

For example, if the inactivated component is marked as [ 900000000000484002 | Ambiguous|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000484002 "900000000000484002 | Ambiguous |") , this will typically mean that there will be more than one component replacing the inactivated component. The possible replacements will be available in the [ 900000000000523009 | POSSIBLY EQUIVALENT TO association reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000523009 "900000000000523009 | POSSIBLY EQUIVALENT TO association reference set \(foundation metadata concept\) |") .

Another example is concepts that are inactivated because they were [ 900000000000482003 | Duplicate|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000482003 "900000000000482003 | Duplicate |") . This is used if two concepts represent the same meaning, because then one of those concepts must be inactivated. The equivalent concept will be represented in the [ 900000000000527005 | SAME AS association reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000527005 "900000000000527005 | SAME AS association reference set \(foundation metadata concept\) |") . Please refer  to [3.2.6.3.2. Representing Historical Associations](3.2.6.3.2.-Representing-Historical-Associations_35985650.html) to see which reference sets relate to the various reasons for inactivation.
