# 3.2.6.3.1. Representing Reasons for Component Inactivation

In the International Edition of SNOMED CT three reference sets of the type [900000000000480006 | Attribute value type reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000480006) are used to indicate the reason why components have been inactivated. These are:

* [900000000000489007 | Concept inactivation indicator attribute value reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000489007)
* [900000000000490003 | Description inactivation indicator attribute value reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000490003)
* [900000000000547002 | Relationship inactivation indicator attribute value reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000547002)

For example, if the inactivated component is marked as [900000000000484002 | Ambiguous|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000484002) , this will typically mean that there will be more than one component replacing the inactivated component. The possible replacements will be available in the [900000000000523009 | POSSIBLY EQUIVALENT TO association reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000523009) .

Another example is concepts that are inactivated because they were [900000000000482003 | Duplicate|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000482003) . This is used if two concepts represent the same meaning, because then one of those concepts must be inactivated. The equivalent concept will be represented in the [900000000000527005 | SAME AS association reference set (foundation metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000527005) . Please refer to [3.2.6.3.2. Representing Historical Associations](https://github.com/IHTSDO/snomedct-refset-guide/blob/main/3%20requirements-and-use-cases/3.2%20use-cases/3.2.6%20maintenance-and-management/3.2.6.3%20managing-component-inactivation/3.2.6.3.2.-Representing-Historical-Associations_35985650.html) to see which reference sets relate to the various reasons for inactivation.
