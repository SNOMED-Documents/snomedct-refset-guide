# 3.2.6. Maintenance and Management

Managing the components used to represent the large number of clinical data entries in EHRs is an important part of the work related to maintaining the integrity and accessibility of health information. Like SNOMED CT components, reference sets are supported by a robust versioning mechanism that allows historically consistent views of SNOMED CT components and derivatives. This allows reference sets to be used to specify changes in use of concepts and descriptions in different parts of an EHR.
