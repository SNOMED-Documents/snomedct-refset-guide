# 3.2.2.1. Linking Concepts to Web Resources

In the example below URLs are used to annotate two [SNOMED CT concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+concept "Glossary link: SNOMED CT concepts") with images on the web. It is not recommended to use this approach to annotate[concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") with text that may require translation to other [languages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language "Glossary link: languages"). Instead, such text should be included under an appropriate [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") type within the [Description file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Description+file "Reference term: Description file"). However, in some cases this type of reference set can be useful to link concepts or descriptions to specific guidance documents or other types of knowledge resources.
