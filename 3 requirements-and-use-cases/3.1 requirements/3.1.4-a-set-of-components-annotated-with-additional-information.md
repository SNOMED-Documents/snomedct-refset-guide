# 3.1.4. A Set of Components Annotated with Additional Information

In some cases, an implementer may need to add additional information about each member of a subset. This information may be additional textual information or additional coded values.

Annotating each member of a subset with additional information can facilitate the processing of subset members and assist in meeting the functional requirements of a system.

Table 3.1.4-1: Requirements for a set of components annotated with additional information

Requirement| Description| Example Use| Reference Set  
---|---|---|---  
**A set of components with free text annotations**|  A set of concepts, descriptions or relationships each annotated with a free text note| Displaying a textual note for each concept in a list. For example, displaying an advisory note on how to request a particular procedure.| [Annotation reference set](Annotation-Reference-Set_35985674.html)  
**A set of components with coded annotations**  
| A set of concepts, descriptions or relationships each annotated with a reference to another component | Marking each concept with a specific coded value to support automated processing of a list. For example, marking each inactive concept with a code that indicates the reason they were inactivated| [Attribute value reference set](5.8.-Attribute-Value-Reference-Set_35985702.html)  
Specifying whether descriptions are preferred or acceptable in a given dialect, care setting or clinical context.| [Language reference set](5.9.-Language-Reference-Set_35985689.html)
