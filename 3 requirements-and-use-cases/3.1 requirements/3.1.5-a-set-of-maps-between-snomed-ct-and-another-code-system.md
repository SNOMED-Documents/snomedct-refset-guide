# 3.1.5. A Set of Maps between SNOMED CT and Another Code System

A map is an association between codes from one code system and codes from another code system, that have the same (or similar) meaning. Mapping is the process of defining a set of maps. Maps are developed in accordance with a documented rationale, for a given purpose. As a result, there may be different maps between the same pair of concepts or terms to meet different use cases. 

The purpose of mapping between SNOMED CT and another code system is to provide a link between  the code systems, to obtain a number of benefits. These may include: 

  * Data reuse - for example, SNOMED CT based clinical data can be reused to report statistical and management information using an alternative classification system
  * Retaining the value of existing data when migrating to newer database formats and code systems
  * Avoiding the need to enter data multiple times and preventing the associated cost and potential errors
  * Promoting interoperability between terminologies, classifications and code systems

Table 3.1.5-1: Requirements for a set of maps between SNOMED CT and another code system

Requirement| Description| Example Use| Reference Set  
---|---|---|---
