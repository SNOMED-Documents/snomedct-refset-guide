# 6.5. Implement and Use

When a reference set has been developed and tested it should be prepared for use by implementing it in the environment where it is going to function. I.e. the implementation process and the tasks involved will vary dependent on the setting.

Often, implementation of a reference set will mean integration with one or more software artefacts, to enable data capture, represented by appropriate reference set members. 

An important part of this process is proper binding between the information model and the reference set to ensure effective integration with data entry and storage functions. Many situations will also involve implementation of two or more interdependent reference sets, which require their dependencies to be considered to reach the most optimal implementation.

In this guide we highlight two aspects that are important when implementing SNOMED CT reference sets, i.e. supporting implementation with proper implementation guidance and considerations related to optimizing the reference set for a particular implementation.
