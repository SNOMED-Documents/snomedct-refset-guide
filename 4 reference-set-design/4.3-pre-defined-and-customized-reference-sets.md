# 4.3. Pre-defined and Customized Reference Sets

SNOMED CT specifies a set of reference set types that follow specific patterns. However, different purposes and uses may impose different requirements. Therefore, flexibility is a core feature of the reference set mechanism. This flexibility is manifested by the fact that reference sets can be applied in ways that meet specific requirements; options include:

| Option                                                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create reference set based on existing pattern**                                                            | Creating a simple reference set, an ordered reference set (or any other reference set) using the predefined pattern for this reference set type. Without modifying or constraining the structure of this pattern. |
| **Create reference set based on existing pattern, however constraining the datatypes of specific attributes** | Create a reference set using a predefined pattern, however specializing the descriptor template, by creating a copy and replacing the \[                                                                          |
| **Customize reference set by defining a new reference set pattern**                                           | Define a new reference set pattern based on new or existing reference set types, attributes, and attribute values. (Since you could use an existing type as a starting point.)                                    |

This means that if the pattern of existing reference set types is not sufficient for local requirements, then new reference set patterns can be specified and included in a national or local SNOMED CT Extension.

## Customized Reference Sets

There might be situations where none of the defined reference set patterns are sufficient to fulfill the requirements for a specific use case for an implementing organization/project. In this case, it is possible to develop customized reference sets, which include the exact attributes necessary to meet the requirements.

If an existing pattern almost meets the requirements a developing organization may want to simply add additional attributes to an existing reference set pattern. If none of the existing patterns can be adapted it is also possible to develop a new reference set pattern or a reference set that does not follow any specified pattern. The different approaches to customizing a reference set are illustrated in the figure below.

Therefore, customized reference sets should be clearly specified, which can be done specifying the reference set pattern in the [reference set descriptor](4.1.1.-Reference-Set-Descriptor<em>35985487.html). Specifying customized reference sets in the [reference set descriptor](4.1.1.-Reference-Set-Descriptor</em>35985487.html) enables users of the reference set to validate any reference set of this particular pattern against the specified definition.</p></figcaption></figure>
