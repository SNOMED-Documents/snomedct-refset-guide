# 2. Subsets, Value Sets and Reference Sets

In this section, we define some important terms that are used throughout this guide. In particular, _subset_ , _value set_ and _reference set_. 

 _Subset_ and _value set_ are general terms that are not specific to SNOMED CT. However, it is important to understand what they mean, and how they relate to SNOMED CT _reference sets_.

In summary:

  * A [subset](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subset "Glossary link: subset") is a set of members all of which are members of another set (from  _set theory_ in mathematics).

  * A [value set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/value+set "Glossary link: value set") is a uniquely identifiable set of valid concept representations, where any concept representation can be tested to determine whether or not it is a member of the  _value set_.

  * A [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set") is a standard format for maintaining and distributing a set of references to [SNOMED CT components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+component "Glossary link: SNOMED CT components").

  

In the following subsections, we describe each of these terms in more detail.

  * [2.2. Value Set](2.2.-Value-Set_35985807.html)
  * [2.3. Reference Set](2.3.-Reference-Set_35985811.html)
